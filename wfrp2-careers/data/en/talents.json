    "description": "You have managed to survive the perils of hedge wizardry and teach yourself more powerful techniques of magic use. This gives you access to spells beyond Petty Magic but since you must figure out each spell on your own, your progress is slower than that of a Magister. Witchcraft allows you to learn any spell from an Arcane Lore with a Casting Number of 15 or less, but you must pay 200 xp for cach one. You can cast these spells without having the Speak Arcane Language skill. However, you must roll an extra d10 when casting one of these spells. This does not add into your Casting Roll but does count for the purposes of Tzeentch's Curse. Once you learn an Arcane Language and an Arcane’ Loge, you no longer have to roll the extra die.",

    "description": "You have studied one of the established witching traditions of the Old World. Like Arcane Lore or Divine Lore, Witchery is not one talent but many. Such is the study and focus required, you can only ever know one Witch Lore Talent and can never also know an Arcane Lore, Dark Lore, or Divine Lore. Each Witch Lore is a separate magical proficiency, the speciality noted in parenthesis. For example: Witch Lore (Hag) is a different talent than Witch Lore (Ice). If you know a Witch Lore, you may cast spells from that lore according to the rules presented in (RoIQ) Chapter IX: Magic and Miracles.",
