Most of the languages of the Old World derive from the same ancient tongue, but the common roots are so deeply buried that for all intents and purposes each race or nation speaks its own specific language. Under normal circumstances, Skill Tests are unnecessary if all speakers know the language. They may be required to imitate or decipher regional accents or to try to speak like a native when you're not. Like Academic Knowledge, Speak Language isn't one skill but many different ones. The most common languages and the areas/people that speak them are as follows: Breton (Bretonnia), Eltharin (Elves), Estalian (Estalia), Halfing (Halfling), Khazalid (Dwarves), Kislevian (Kislev), Norse (Norsca), Reikspiel (the Empire), Tilean (Tilea). Another language is Classical, an old tongue favoured by academics but rarely spoken anymore. Less civilized languages include the Dark Tongue (Beastman, Chaos), the Goblin Tongue (Orcs, Goblins, Hobgoblins), and Grumbarth (Ogres).",
