    "description": "(ToS) The eldest and wisest of monks eventually rise to become the leaders of their monasteries. Worshippers sometimes seek these abbots out to gain their advice on matters of faith or to gain greater understanding about the religious world, while priests and initiates answer to them in all things. Most abbots choose to remain secluded in their monasteries until death takes them, but some venture out into the wider world once again. Few abbots deign to get involved in temple politics, preferring the solitude of their own world or their journeys to the machinations of their cult. For this reason an abbot is rarely the head of a mendicant order, leaving the organisation and politicking to a high priest.",

Its members include warriors, priests, and Vampire hunters, but in many situations, a far subtler hand is needed, and such are the abilities of the Agents of the Shroud. These scholarly types are trained in careful observation, medical examination, and logical deduction, so they may identify Vampire or Undead activity without being detected. Some of them turn their results over to more martially skilled members of their cult, but they are quite capable of enacting their own justice and putting an end to those the Fellowship call “the Enemies of Life.” The Agents of the Shroud investigate any suspicious death for signs of necromancy or dark magic, so they are often involved in murder mysteries that turn out to contain no mystical elements. Their services are appreciated by the victim’s family regardless, and the Agents are happy to help any departed spirits rest.",

The Emperor and the Elector Counts make and enforce the laws, with the support of the various churches (Sigmar and Ulric most conspicuously). Nonetheless, ardent political activists are a common sight in the cities of the Empire. These Agitators organize on behalf of various causes, handing out leaflets, giving rousing speeches, and stirring up the populace. The lunatic fringe is simply ignored, but successful Agitators – those who can tap into the wellspring of Peasant and Burgher resentment – are usually viewed as a threat to the state. They are hounded by local watchman, accused of heresy by church officials, or forced to submit to the tender mercies of the Witch Hunters. Agitators continue on despite the risks. Some truly believe in their cause, but others are cynical power seekers as corrupt as those they rail against.",

Their most common job is breeding riding horses and destriers for the horse markets, but animal trainers are also skilled dog and bird handlers that accompany nobles’ hunting parties. Carnivals employ animal trainers as ringmasters to delight the masses with dancing bears and prancing ponies. Animal trainers can also serve the role of beast handlers in pit fighting arenas, though little effort is expended training the ornery fighting animals that were originally captured in the wild. Though Kislevite bear tamers are famous for their ability to train wild bears, most trained animals are born in captivity.",

Anointed Priests are gifted with the Divine Lore of the deity they serve and consequently, they’re expected to take on challenges suitable to their new blessings. They often have all the attributes that their God admires, acting as beacons of faith to others in the Old World. Anointed Priests are greatly trusted by the common folk, who will often listen to them over both Nobles and Politicians, granting them a great deal of temporal power to complement the spiritual.",

    "description": "(SH) While physicians prescribe cures for their patients’ various ills, it is the apothecary who actually makes the medicine. Specialists in minerals, chemicals, and salts derived from organic matter, the apothecary mixes powders to be taken with wine, unguents to apply to infected areas, and medicinal incenses to drive away unhealthy vapours. Guild law allows them to prescribe for minor ailments, such as a cold or stomach-ache, but few do since many physicians are resentful of the competition. While some apothecaries move on to higher careers in medicine or academia, others turn their knowledge to personal greed or succumb to a desire to harm others. Some apothecaries have been known to feed their clients drugs disguised as medicine, forcing them to come back and pay higher prices to feed their addiction, while others sell their services as poisoners, splitting the profits with an aggrieved widow or heir.",

    "description": "(Core) Humans born with magical talent are dangerous and feared individuals. Daemons and disaster gather about an untrained Wizard. To deal with this threat the Empire sends such people away to join one of the eight Orders of Wizardry. During their apprenticeship young Wizards learn how to practice magic safely, and contemplate which Order they will eventually join. Some apprentices will be bound to serve the Wizard who uncovered their talents, whilst others adventure to garner enough money to pay for their tutelage at the Colleges of Magic. Elves are naturally magical, and do not need to attend these Human institutions, learning from their own lore masters instead. See Chapter 7: Magic of the Core Rulebook for more details on the Orders of Magic.",

    "description": "(WC) The Artillerist is skilled at operating all manner of siege weapons, from the ballista to the trebuchet, and even gunpowder devices like the cannon, mortar and Hellblaster Volley Gun of the Imperial arsenal. Field repairs are often necessary when a wheel breaks or a gun carriage cracks, and a smart Artillerist quickly learns how to make temporary repairs to ensure minimal interruption in firing rate. Artillerists rely on teamwork and command groups of Engineers to operate their weapons effectively. They are rarely found outside of a large army. Part engineer, part soldier, and all target, Artillerists must learn to take care of themselves on the battlefield. Generally they are far enough behind the battle lines to be out of danger, but the effectiveness of their weaponry makes them favourite targets for enemy missile fire, flying creatures, and magical attacks. Also, moving the various engines around is hard work under the best of conditions; over muddy, rutted, rock-strewn battlefields it can be an endurance test with lives hanging in the balance. The career of an Artillerist is not all glory, as is frequently supposed.",

Chaos Champions eliminate anyone they see as a rival, butchering their underlings to ensure their continued place at the head of their armies. As a result, many Aspiring Champions leave the service of a Chaos Champion to create their own warband. Unfortunately? Aspiring Champions can only recall the most pertinent details of their past, and many assume new identities to replace those lost to them.",

    "description": "(SH) The future is a frightening thing for many people: war, the threat of chaos, disease, financial ruin, and betrayal – there is so much to worry about. People have many questions about the future, and the astrologer is there to supply the answers, whether or not she knows what she is talking about. Surrounded by star charts and arcane equipment, the astrologer seeks answers by charting the motions and relative positions of the planets in the heavens. Some are genuinely talented and try to do their best, while others are little better than fakers who tell their clients whatever they want to hear. Nobles and other powerful people are suspicious of those who can tell their future and zealously guard the time of their births. To cast the horoscope of a ruler without permission is considered treason, and many an astrologer has had to make a hasty exit after just trying to satisfy their curiosity.",

They are not as learned as Physicians, which is why Physicians maintain a separate guild, but they know quite a lot about anatomy. While they do cut hair and shave, they are more noted for their bleedings, surgeries, and amputations. Barber-Surgeons carry a variety of razor-sharp blades, from small scalpels to enormous bone saws. They have even more sinister looking tools for the most hated of their avocations: dentistry. Many large ships have a dedicated Barber-Surgeon as part of the crew; they are also common in towns and cities.",

In most cases, they have also become even more fervent admirers of their Grail Knight and worshippers of the Lady of the Lake, having seen what the flower of Bretonnian chivalry is truly capable of. Battle Pilgrims are the effective leaders of groups of Grail Pilgrims, as the Grail Knight never condescends to give orders to peasant rabble. Some Grail Pilgrims resent taking orders from someone no better than they, so Battle Pilgrims often have to impose order by force. Wiser Grail Pilgrims note that their chances of survival are greatly increased by doing as the Battle Pilgrims say.",

Bears are perceived as living embodiments of the land’s enduring might and strength, and the struggles all Kislevites must endure. Therefore, boyars often recruit bear tamers to support their armed forces, keeping bears as inspiring mascots and sometimes for use in war. As Kislevites gather in great numbers to see bears, bear trainers are also common in Kislev’s famous circuses and on the streets during festival time, where they dance or show-wrestle for coin. If you are rolling randomly for your starting career and are not rolling a Kislevite, you can substitute bear tamer for entertainer with your GM’s permission.",

For the most part, they are a defensive order, protecting the great temples and graveyards of the Empire and the dignitaries of the cult, only riding to war in exceptional circumstances, such as during a crusade against the Vampire counts. Unlike most knights, they are trained in the use of ranged weapons to prevent their enemies from bringing their strength to bear in close quarters. This, along with their foreboding black obsidian armour and their strict vow of silence when on duty, means they are shunned by most other knightly orders, but such is the price of duty.",

Smearing an opponent involves physical mud, backstabbing involves a knife, and the losers in political contests really are gutted. Courtiers in the area thus tend to be a bit more physical than those in other regions. The Border Courtier haunts the home of a Border Prince, hoping to survive long enough to take that position himself. Scheming, murder, and betrayal are his normal modes of operation. Paranoia is an occupational hazard, and hypocrisy is a qualification for the job.",

Bounty Hunters are professional killers who place little value on sanctity of life. They are utterly ruthless, using their formidable skills to track and eliminate their quarries.

Burghers are shop owners, petty merchants, excisemen, traders, and local officials. They are neither as despised as the peasantry nor as exalted as the nobility.

Although cadets do learn to fight, the focus of their training is leadership. Some come from noble families, but this is by no means a given. Those who earned a place with battlefield exploits are more respected because they have lived war, not just read about it in books. Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Cadet for Soldier or Student with your GM’s permission.",

Cantors are responsible for leading choirs during services as well as for instructing individual choristers. Some cantors are also skilled musicians and write new hymns in praise of their Gods. As well as singing hymns, many cantors are skilled at performing incantations and rhythmic chanting that aids priests in performing divine rituals, and for the most potent of rituals a high priest may request the presence of many cantors. The common symbol of office for a cantor is a short staff used to strike the ground (or out of tune choristers, if necessary) to keep tune with the music when leading a choir. A skilful cantor can easily enhance the reputation of a temple and its priests.",

They often work alone, though a new recruit may be paired with an older individual. Obviously, a single Human, no matter how well trained, cannot expect to take on an entire Orc war-band, so the Shepherds are trained to gather information, slow the band down, and report its location to the local nobility. They also look after flocks of sheep. A shepherd who loses his sheep is mercilessly mocked by his fellows, which leads many of them to take absurd risks to recover even a single lost lamb. Male and female characters may freely enter this career. Bretonnian nobles would have to conceal their noble background to do so, but that does happen.",

A Catechist is usually responsible for the religious education of a temple’s initiates, even if they themselves are merely lay members. Not all Catechists are religious in nature – some concentrate on studying the arcane but lack the talents to become a wizard, instead teaching theory to apprentices at one of the Colleges of Magic.",

Most Cenobites are Human; members of other races rarely show much interest, though most monasteries would admit them if they asked. Unwanted children are sometimes left on the doorsteps of monasteries. These children are taken in; those who do not run away are accepted as Cenobites. Most run away. Option: It is possible for those who seek to purify mind and body to volunteer to become cenobites, even though most are raised in the role. With GM approval, the cenobite career may be entered from apprentice wizard, initiate, grave robber, or zealot.",

With their glib tongues and ready wits they bilk the gullible out of their fortunes and escape with both the money and their lives. For a Charlatan, lying is like breathing. Common Charlatans are content to sell worthless miracle cures and trinkets that will supposedly ward off black magic whereas more skilled ones fake being other professions to collect consultation fees and sell off property that they don’t own. Legendary Charlatans run con schemes that try to take Nobles and rich Merchants for all they’re worth.",

Their techniques employed to investigate the various Chaos cults, revolutionaries, criminals, hostile organisations, spies, and manifold other “threats” are often brutal, leaving the chekist with an ugly reputation. Their headquarters squat in Kislev city, but rumours suggest they have offices throughout the Ancient Widow’s land, all siphoning information back to the capital. Some suggest the chekist even have agents in the Empire and beyond, each monitoring the activities of foreign threats to the Ice Queen and her rule; but this, of course, is denied.",

Though not a true branch of the Templars, they often have cause to join forces with their, sometimes overzealous, brethren.

They infiltrate organisations to learn what they can, reporting their findings to their superiors – though who exactly “they” are is unknown. This organisation draws from a vast array of talent, from ex-Witch Hunters to Mutants.",

A precarious system of roads connects the villages, towns, and cities, and it is here that the Coachmen earn their pay, working for one of the many Imperially chartered coaching companies. The roads are frequently in ill repair or plagued by Goblins, Beastmen, and brigands. Nonetheless, the Coachmen risk life and limb to bring passengers and cargo safely through the hazards of the Imperial roadways. Each day is a race to reach the next settlement or coaching inn before sunset. No one wants to be on the road in the dark of the night, especially when the Chaos moon is in the sky.",

Crime Lords are the leaders of these groups and they are powerful and dangerous folk. To be counted among their ranks one must be clever, ambitious and completely ruthless. Most claw their way up from the bottom, learning every dirty trick in the book as they ascend to power. Crime Lords can seldom afford the luxury of trust. They are experts at evaluating both people and situations to seek whatever advantage they can. Many Crime Lords become involved in local politics to further their power.",

    "description": "(ToS) It is perhaps the greatest deed a templar can perform to go to war in the name of the Gods. In ages past, especially during the crusades against Araby, it was unusual for a knight to not go on crusade with his order. But in more recent times crusades are far less common, especially on such a scale. Crusaders are those knights who are veterans of crusades, who have earned great glory for their order and faith through their deeds in foreign lands against the enemies of the cult. They are world-wise men, skilled at fighting in all manner of conditions and against all manner of enemies, and many knights who return from crusade find their deeds forever etched in the legends of their order. Not all crusaders hail from the nobility or from a knightly order, although it is certainly true that most do. Some are pious men who are mere soldiers, fighting alongside the armies of templars and knights, and their deeds are no less noble despite their lesser status.",

    "description": "(New) Dilettantes like to think of themselves as scholars, and, indeed, they may pass as scholars among most folk; they read and write, for a start. However, they often lack the discipline or passion that leads true scholars to focus on one task and become truly skilled at that, rather spreading their efforts across many. Most dilettantes are from wealthy backgrounds; the poor find that imminent starvation focuses the mind wonderfully. A dilettante prides himself on knowing a little bit about almost everything, starting a variety of projects, pursuing a dozen interests at the same time. A dilettante is a professional amateur – interested in the arts, the burgeoning field of science, literature, religion, and virtually any other topic. At least, until another subject matter comes along and grabs their attention.",

    "description": "(Core) A complex legal system of formal duels was established throughout the Empire ages ago. Duellists are specialists in the lethal application of sword and pistol, hiring themselves out to safeguard the honour of others, though many of their kind come from the ranks of younger Nobles who duel for their own purposes. Duellists come in two varieties: happy-go-lucky devil-may-care swashbucklers who regard their exploits as a continuous adventure, and deadly serious fighters who wear their honour on their sleeves and are very quick to take offence at slights, imagined or otherwise.",

Some prefer a more preserving process after their death, for themselves or their animal companions, and they turn to the embalmers. These masters of pickling, preservation, and taxidermy are not just a fad of the wealthy. The individuals increasingly have a hand in the growing field of medicine, and money can be made hand over fist in selling their curios to customers with a particular purpose in mind. Many priests of Morr (and much of the general population) consider cutting bits off people and putting them in jars to be an assault on both the body and spirit of the deceased, and Witch Hunters are well aware of how easily such merchants turn to the dark arts. As such, many embalmers choose to hide their Human exhibits behind their animal displays or their surgery services until the day scientists of their calibre are finally given the respect and recognition they deserve. Embalmers don’t usually encounter the Undead, but they work hand-in-glove with grave robbers and tomb robbers who often do. They also tend to know a lot of necromancers – not that they would ever reveal their customer’s identity, of course.",

They pay no attention to the legal authority of princes or, indeed, to law, relying entirely on their own sense of ethics and ability to uncover true villains. Most Enforcers regard rogue Enforcers as the blackest of villains because their actions mean that any Enforcer is at risk of being run out of an area. Enforcers are almost never found outside the Border Princes because the authorities elsewhere take a very dim view of people taking the law into their own hands. The authorities in the Border Princes do, too, but they generally can’t do anything about it.",

The Imperial School of Engineers in Altdorf is famed for its bizarre inventions, which can be most useful if they manage to function correctly. Outside the Empire, Tileans are particularly famed for their bold engineering ideas.",

Some do it for the roar of the crowd and others for the money. Many become Entertainers just to escape the hard life of the Imperial villager. Entertainers travel frequently, sometimes alone but more often in troupes that perform in villages, towns, and cities. Lucky troupes get continuous bookings, sometimes spending months in the same city. The less fortunate scrape by as they can, always looking for a more appreciative crowd (or a less suspicious watch) over the next hill.

    "description": "(Core) The Estalian Kingdoms are southwest of the Empire. There the threat of Chaos seems remote. The Chaos Wastes are quite distant from this sunny land, which has never witnessed the wrath of bloodthirsty hordes the way the Empire and Kislev have. Its people engage in other pursuits, from science and scholarship to crime and vendetta. One thing Estalians dearly love is swordplay. Its cities sport many fencing schools, each with its own style. Many of these styles are descended from the teachings of Master Figueroa, a legendary swordsman who applied the latest scientific theories to his swordplay with spectacular results. Followers of the Figueroa style, known as Diestro, fight and duel across Estalia. Some, bored with their homeland, seek excitement elsewhere, favouring Tilea and Bretonnia. The bravest travel northeast to the Empire to test their rapiers against worthy opponents, and to see a land in the front line of the struggle against Chaos. Note: If this is your Starting Career, you are from Estalia, but have come to the Empire to seek adventure.",

The constant flow of money ensures public works and servants receive the funding they need, whilst also lining the pockets of the politicians.

Since this is unpopular reality, most lawmakers distance themselves from the collection of monies, relying on specially hired Excisemen to do their work instead. Of all the people in the city, the Exciseman is likely the most unpopular, right alongside the dyers, beggars, and the rest of the rabble. Though they face hostility at every turn, most Excisemen know their duty is a necessary one. Still, these individuals are rarely well paid for their thankless job. As a result, few of them enjoy what they do and look for the fastest route to improve their lot, either through skimming the coffers and double-dealing or working extra hard in the faint hope of securing a better position in the government.

    "description": "(SH) Among the many dangers (natural and unnatural) facing the people of the Old World is possession by malefic spirits. Seeking to do harm in the land of the living, these spirits take over the bodies of their victims with the goal of wreaking as much havoc as possible. Some are nearly mindless, sending their hosts on violent rampages ending most often in the death of all concerned. Others are subtler in their activities, using the victim’s unwitting friends, family, and associates to help it carry out horrifying deeds. Among the Undead, possession commonly reflects a desire to resume the life the spirit once led, to be close again to a loved one, or to have revenge. To battle this vile threat and, if possible, save the life and soul of the possessed victim, some cults have assigned particular individuals to be specialists in driving the possessing spirit out. These exorcists spend countless hours pouring over tomes of forbidden lore. They are men and women of dedication and strong will – they have to be, for exorcism is a test of faith and will between exorcist and spirit. Some, however, crack under the strain and break down, their licenses revoked and their careers over. Others become corrupted by the lore they studied so assiduously and begin to serve the powers they once fought against.",

Successful bands of Herrimaults are almost always led by a Faceless, an individual highly experienced in the pursuit of right and justice by unconventional means. Faceless, unlike conventional Outlaw Chiefs, rarely have to worry about being stabbed in the back by their own followers. Similarly, most encourage potential Faceless in their band to develop and then establish their own group. Ethics have their advantages. On the other hand, they have to keep their band fed, find shelter, and right wrongs, all without stepping over the ethical lines that they set for themselves. Eventually, some find the pressure too great. Most Faceless cultivate an air of mystery, wearing a deep hood to hide their features. Some are rumoured to be powerful nobles, even Grail Knights, righting wrongs they cannot publicly acknowledge.",

In cities, burghers have begun to appear. Their equivalent in the countryside is an emerging class of landed gentry. Land is often parcelled out to commoners as a reward for military service, or merchants invest their wealth by purchasing the estates of impoverished nobles. Rarely, tenant peasants save enough to buy the fields they till from their lord. Land is inherited, but no farmer’s claim yet spans more than a couple of generations. A farmer employs many hands to work the land, but he toils as hard as any peasant, for the wealth that hard work brings provides a significant social standing in the rural community.",

They prefer to attack from ambush, using their superior skill with missile weapons to neutralize the size advantage of their foes. Since the Moot shares a border with Sylvania, the Fieldwardens have particular expertise in dealing with the living dead.

They work in small crews, and when on the water every decision is their own. This spirited nature is one reason why dockside taverns are always unruly.

In the bustling docks, the screech of a Foreman’s whistle sends the unemployed running from their smoky taverns, all desperate to shift backbreaking, heavy cargo from quay to warehouse in exchange for some coin. As Foremen are often paid according to the speed of their men’s work, they can be pitiless taskmasters, “motivating” their temporary workers by any means possible. In contrast, Stevedore Foremen lead their long-term gangs with tangible pride, confidently negotiating with dock owners and traders for extra work and wages as well as actively taking part in guild matters and turf disputes.

    "description": "(SH) Forgers are the artists of the criminal world, but theirs is a calling of imitation, not original creation. Forgers make their living by copying a work by another and passing it off as an original, whether it is a painting of an emperor, the seal on an “official” document, or a signature on an incriminating letter. Forgers prefer to work in relative anonymity; not only is their work a crime often punished by mutilation, but revealing one of their creations as a fake spoils some of the triumph felt in a successful job. Note: The Old World Armoury includes rules for coin forgery.",

A Witch Hunter, Berndt of Wurtbad, was a particular foe of the cults of Slaanesh, the Chaos God of Sensuality and Pleasure. Berndt saw how decadence and lust lead inexorably to the embrace of Slaanesh. After years of blood and fire, Berndt laid aside his sword and torch, gave away his possessions, and began to walk the roads of the Empire preaching a message of poverty, chastity, and obedience. He wore nothing but a hair shirt and lived off the charity of the common folk. His fervent belief was that a humble life of poverty was the surest way to fight the insidious seduction of Chaos. The Order of St. Berndt was the first mendicant order of the Empire, though several others have sprung up since.",

    "description": "(BotD) Frogwives are a common sight in Mousillon’s villages. They take the buckets of snails and frogs caught by the village Swampaires (often their husbands, sons, or fathers) and gut them long into the evening. A Frogwife is not only an expert at the gutting and cleaning of frogs and snails, but also forms a crucial part of a village’s social structure. Frogwives tend to be relatively knowledgeable about the surrounding world, sometimes being permitted to leave the village for short periods of time to find useful herbs or other essentials from neighbouring villages. Some Frogwives are experts in the use of herbs, folk medicine, or some other esoteric but useful pursuit. It is a rare Frogwife who does not know the majority of what is going on in her village, and Frogwives have a deserved reputation as gossips, storytellers, and the originators of many strange superstitions. A Frogwife is almost always a woman, and it is a great shame for a man to labour at the swamp bucket. With your GM’s permission, when rolling your starting career you can substitute Frogwife for Camp Follower.",

Sometimes things go wrong and gamblers lose large sums of money. In these cases, a swift escape is in order, before the creditors discover that the debts can’t be paid.

    "description": "(KotG) Grail Pilgrims are peasants devoted to the Lady of the Lake, as represented by her Grail Knights. They believe that Grail Knights are paragons of courage, justice, and courtesy, and that the best way they, as lowly peasants, can serve the Lady is to serve a Grail Knight. To this end, they choose a Grail Knight and follow him around. If the knight drops anything (broken spoons, old buttons, and so on), they seize them and treasure them as relics, a means of contact with the holy. If the Grail Knight needs anything, they get it for him. And if the Grail Knight is in danger, they try to fight for him. Most Grail Pilgrims do not have long lives. If a Grail Knight dies whilst questing, his Grail Pilgrims descend on the body, stripping it of relics. Many then turn the corpse into a Grail Reliquae, which they then carry around in place of the Knight himself.",

A grandmaster is not only one of the most fearsome warriors in the Old World, but also a legendary commander and leader of men. There are very few grandmasters in the Old World, for even amongst those dedicated individuals who have the skill and strength of mind to become a Knight of the Inner Circle, few have what it takes to reach the pinnacle of knighthood. A grandmaster is always at the forefront of an army when it marches to war, leading his fellow knights, and often the entire army, into battle. He is usually amongst the most trusted of military advisors and generals, and when not engaged in warfare is often charged with planning for it. A grandmaster of a templar order is often a leading personality within a religious cult as well, commanding total loyalty from its warriors.",

He not only has to bury the dead six feet deep in the cold, hard ground but also guard against those who would disturb their rest, be they rats, bone pickers, grave robbers, or worse. In small towns and rural areas, a grave warden cannot rely on the town militia or Morr’s Black Guard to keep away the restless dead and hungry Ghouls. Meanwhile, few value his company, for he carries the stench of death and sodden mud wherever he goes. It is a lonely life, but many grave wardens come to prefer the company of the dead to that of the living.",

    "description": "(RotIQ) Few Ungol women develop magical powers without first demonstrating “the sight.” Thus, most hag witches – women who can invoke the spirits of Kislev – were wise women first. Their powers are said to be a blessing and a curse, for although the hags can undoubtedly aid their local communities, the spirits demand a high price for their compliance: premature aging. Because of this consequence, most wise women dread the possibility of the spirits answering their call. As well as the wise women, those who suffer a great loss – such as the death of a husband or child – may also be chosen by the Ancient Widow and gain an intimate understanding of Kislev’s tormented spirits. Hag witches who come to power in this way often live alone, grieving for their lost loved ones and fading youth.",

They lead private lives, keen to avoid those who may take offense at their trade and beliefs, and are generally welcomed by locals for the services they provide. A select few Hedge Masters work directly for their Hedgewise, seeking out and neutralising threats to the Hedgefolk.

A Hedgewise may need to tackle a multitude of different threats, ranging from itinerant Warrior-Priests keen to spread Sigmar’s Word at the end of a hammer, to secretive Cults who could bring the wrath of the Witch Hunters down upon the local community. Indeed, many Hedgewise soon learn a deep hatred of the servants of the Ruinous Powers, for they bring unwanted attention to the Hedgefolk, and are anathema to their way of life. Because of this, it is not uncommon to find some Hedgewise crossing the Hedge to hunt real Witches with as much fervour, if not more, as the Magisters and the Cult of Sigmar.",

The Herrimaults hold themselves above both groups by keeping to a strict code of morality. Whilst they operate outside the laws of Bretonnia, they do so because the laws are unjust. A Herrimault always acts rightly. Of course, most Bretonnian nobles see no difference, and so the Herrimaults are hunted as enthusiastically as other Outlaws. A Herrimault’s ethical obligations do bring popularity among the peasants, and the braver souls often seek to join up. Even a few nobles, shocked by abuses they are unable to legally prevent, have been known to take up the bow of the Herrimault.",

Unlike Taal’s Chosen, the Horned Hunters give up much in the way of a material life. They shun normal clothing and armour and wear animal skins, loincloths, or less. Part of their initiation into this group is to undergo extensive tattooing, covering their chest and face. Horned Hunters prowl the woods both within the Taalbaston and throughout Talabecland and claim allegiance only to Taal. While they lack the fiery rhetoric of most zealots, they are still fervent in their beliefs and believe that conversion comes from actions, rather than words.",

Their skills with scimitar, spear, and horse bow are expertly honed hunting kyazak on the Endless Steppe, a land they constantly patrol at the order of the Tzarina. Their most common tactic is to circle their enemy and pour arrow after arrow into them. Amongst the embattled Ungols of the Troll Country, all able-bodied individuals are required to fight, especially when Chaos marauders attack. Thus, it is common to find women amongst rotas of northern horse archers, a tradition southern Kislevites sometimes find difficult to accept.",

It seems every stable has a grinning coper offering “the very best horse flesh on the market, sire,” descended from “the strongest bloodlines of the Ostermarker Veldt, sire.” As horses are central to Kislevite life, the market is incredibly competitive, and buyers have a hard time finding a reliable dealer, especially as most will try any underhanded trick to ensure a sale. Some disreputable copers happily paint rotten teeth white, pass off diseased nags as “shy,” and proudly boast infertile stallions will “sire a line o’ beauties, sire.” Indeed, the only place horse copers never sell to is the knacker’s yards, though it is a good source for stock.

Although Peasants till parts of the land, huge expanses of the Empire are still covered with forest or are hostile to agriculture. These are the lands where Hunters and trappers thrive. They use the same techniques as their ancestors to take down game, be it a trap or a well-placed shot. It takes skill to stalk wild animals while avoiding the dark creatures of the woods. Hunters in their animal skin clothes and fur hats may appear uncouth to city folks, but they don’t much care what others think of them.",

To do this, they must mirror the Ancient Widow as closely as possible, so they swear vows of chastity (to represent being widowed) before forging forth with cold determination in their hearts. Maidens of the ice can be found in the most unlikely places as they quest for understanding, but most commonly, they wander the frozen oblast, facing kyazak, the land’s spirits, and ferocious Greenskins with equal resolve. An ice maiden’s vow of chastity ends when she gains insight into her wintry magic and becomes a full ice witch; however, for some, this understanding never comes, and they remain forever alone.",

It takes great dedication and training to become a Priest. Initiates are Priests-in-training. They undergo harsh instruction under strict teachers, and until they are finished they are not allowed to preach or conduct services. Their training includes literacy and calligraphy, the study of scriptures, and the art of the sermon. They also learn the basics of weapon use so the temple can be defended in times of need.",

You can learn more about the faiths of the Old World in Chapter 8: Religion and Belief of the Core Rulebook. Your choice gives you another skill or talent, as detailed in Church Skills and Talents entry of your God’s description.",

    "description": "(Core) Originally, the Kossars were an Ungol tribe that lived northeast of the Empire. An eastern people known as the Gospodars invaded this region, subjugated the Ungols, and founded the nation of Kislev. During this conflict, the Kossars sold their skills to the Gospodars as Mercenaries, fighting against other Ungol tribes. Their unique style of fighting impressed the Gospodar nobility, and since that time Kossar regiments have served the Tzars of Kislev. These days the Kossars are no longer a tribe, but a tough military unit drawn from all over Kislev. They are armed with bows and great axes, making them quite flexible on the battlefield. Many Kossars, tired of the ceaseless warfare of their native land, travel to the Empire to become Mercenaries or adventurers. Note: If this is your Starting Career, you are from Kislev.",

What else would you expect from a nation who has forgotten the true meaning of chivalry, the true meaning of honour, and the true meaning of courage? In Bretonnia, knights start off riding their own trail, as they set off on their errantry tour. Bretonnian knights learn from the best school there is: genuine experience. At the start of their tour, they don’t have any genuine experience, but most make up the deficit with their enthusiasm. Knights Errant are expected to travel widely, often alone, seeking out perilous situations in which to prove their worth. As a result, they can be found anywhere in the Old World, sometimes to the regret of the natives.",

Their order has spread from Tilea and Estalia in recent centuries, championing their cult’s values in battles across the Old World. Gathering as a large force only rarely, they instead travel in small groups or individually, acting as advisors to nobles and their generals on the art of war. Sometimes they command units or whole armies in the field, using their skills and reputation to keep militia troops from breaking and mercenaries loyal. More and more in the south of the Empire, the Knights of the Blazing Sun and the Cult of Myrmidia are seen as a challenge to the martial primacy of the Cult of Ulric and the Knights of the White Wolf. At some point in his career, a Knight of the Blazing Sun will be sent out on his own for one to two years, to test what he has learned and forge his skills in the crucible of combat. Many an isolated village, farmstead, or coaching inn has been saved by a young Knight taking charge of the defence.",

They have proven themselves valiant and loyal time and time again and for that they are brought into the inner circle of the order. They command Knights in the field, represent the order at court, and make the important decisions. They are some of the greatest warriors the Old World has to offer and many of them have been entrusted with dangerous secrets about the foundations of their group. Each one of them aspires to become the Grand Master of his order. That is the pinnacle of knighthood.",

Unlike their sister order the Black Guard, the Knights of the Raven are ruthless and aggressive, seeking out their enemy rather than waiting for Undead to come to them. At the moment, a great many of the knights are stationed in the town of Siegfriedhof of Stirland on the border of Sylvania. So far, they have only conducted raids, but as their numbers and intelligence grows, and the truth about Mannfred’s return becomes undeniable, they will begin a crusade to take that bleak land away from its dark lords once again.",

Though they rarely leave the confines of Talabheim, their skills serve them equally well from the Great Forest to the Drakwald.

They are used to illuminate the major streets and thoroughfares, particularly in wealthy neighbourhoods. Altdorf was the first city to install streetlamps and those surrounding the Emperor’s Palace are particularly ornate. Lamplighters are responsible for maintaining the streetlamps and lighting them each night as dusk falls. They carry a variety of candles and matches and some even use the slow burning matches common to firearms. City dwellers are proud of their streetlamps, seeing them as symbols of sophistication and civilisation. Such is the threat of fire in the closely packed buildings that interfering with the lamplighters is punishable by death.

Still, the training and equipment that Men-at-Arms receive are not very good, and whilst they do receive some pay, it is far less than you might expect for risking your life. Most important, they are given no choice in the matter. As a result, it is not uncommon for Men-at-Arms to seize any chance to desert, and many deserters take up a life of adventure.",

Until they can prove their value to the Dark Gods, they are simply Marauders. Most Marauders are the core of the Chaos Hordes. They flock to the banners of their Champions, throwing their weight behind any cause, whether it’s the bidding of their Gods or the call to battle. When not part of a great army, they spend their time raiding villages of the Empire (Cathay, for Hung Marauders). Natural fighters, they are hardened by the bleak land and bred for battle. They hold all others in contempt. Note: The Marauder career is open to Norsemen, Kurgan, and Hung. The latter two are generally horsemen, hence this career allows for Marauders that serve as horsemen. For details on these peoples, see Chapter XII: Hordes of Chaos in Tome of Corruption.",

    "description": "(Core) Marines are ship-borne soldiers who can be found in the Imperial fleet and onboard the larger private vessels. They protect their ships from pirates, Norse marauders, and other raiders. Unlike seamen, whose primary duty is sailing the ship, Marines are onboard only to fight. When in port, Marines frequently form press gangs to fill out the ship’s crew. More than one unsuspecting citizen has awoken at sea after taking a belaying pin to the head from an overzealous press ganger. Due to these activities, and their own drunken brawling, Marines are resented in many seaside communities.

    "description": "(Core) A Master Wizard is one who wields magic with surety and finesse. Elf Wizards find this level of spell casting easy to attain, but for a Human, it is a life’s work. By the time they reach this level of mastery, most Wizards begin to exhibit eccentricities and physical changes wrought by close association with magic. Master Wizards usually prefer to spend their time researching or politicking with fellow magisters. However, their Order usually requires them to adventure in the world at large, furthering the cause of their art, and seeking out young folk to apprentice. Note: If you are Human you must continue to pay dues to your Order for the duration of this career. Most colleges charge Master Wizards a reduced rate of one crown in every twenty. Elves do not belong to the Orders of Magic, and thus owe nothing.",

When the nobility get involved, people are beaten or hanged and food is taken, only making matters worse. However, the peasantry are far from living in a cooperative idyll, and disputes do arise between villages. Mediators are the peasants chosen to resolve those disputes. They live in one village and deal with the representatives, normally other Mediators, of villages with which they have a dispute. Mediators do not normally have the authority to make decisions, so they must try for a solution they can sell to their neighbours. Most Mediators are officially herders, as this gives them an excuse to be in odd places if the nobility find them. Whilst the overwhelming majority are men, a few female Mediators do exist.",

    "description": "(Core) War never ends in the Old World and that means there is always need for fighting men. While the Empire does maintain a standing army, its strength is bolstered with Mercenaries. Nobles and rich Merchants also hire such fighters to protect their interests, many having what amounts to private armies. Mercenaries range from wild youths with a taste for adventure to grizzled professional soldiers who’ve seen a dozen battles or more. These sell-swords come from all over, though Tilea is particular famed for its regiments. All Mercenaries dream of untold riches; for most of them, the reality is an early death and an unmarked grave. Note: During character creation, if you take Common Knowledge (Tilea) and Speak Language (Tilean), your character can be from Tilea at your option.",

Members agree to spend a certain amount of time each year – usually seven days – practicing together on common land. Even this small amount of training can be the difference between life and death on the blood-soaked battlefields of the Old World. Militia Captains are either civil leaders or retired military types. Some militias must provide their own equipment, while the local nobility equips others. This means that while some militia units appear for duty in smart uniforms with well-maintained equipment, others have little more than their patchwork clothes and hunting bows.",

Vital but cheap supplies might be transported by a single Muleskinner, while more valuable goods merit at least a few men, and possibly mercenary guards as well. Sometimes, the Muleskinners just don’t let on that they are carrying anything valuable and just hope the bandits ignore them. With all their travel, Muleskinners often know the Borderlands better than just about anyone else, and some choose to put that knowledge to use earning a living in other ways. Muleskinners also hold mule skinning contests. The dead mule record is under a minute; the live mule record, held unchallenged by Alberic “Flat Face” Schilp, is five and a half minutes.",

Navigators are, by necessity, cartographers, charting the course of their voyages so that they may retrace them or that others may follow their route. As there are no compasses in the world, all ships employ a skilled Navigator, as do some overland expeditions.",

Now newssheets have become common in the towns and cities of the Empire. They are usually published once a day and are filled with local news and sensational tales. A big story may merit a special edition. Newssheet vendors walk the streets, calling out the top headlines and trying to outdo each other with their theatrics. There are many newssheet publishers in each city and the competition amongst them is savage. It is not unknown for rival vendors to fight each other in the streets. Ironically, big brawls of this type often become tomorrow’s top news item.

    "description": "(Core) The Nobles are the ruling class of the Empire. They wield the power, they control the land, and they make the laws. The most important Noble families are those of Imperial Electors and of course the Emperor himself. There are hundreds of others though, and they all vie for more money and more power. Some seek their fortunes in war, others in business or politics. None would sully themselves by practicing a common trade. The most contemptible Nobles do nothing at all, merely live off their family wealth and attend an endless array of parties, dances, and gala events. The younger children of Noble houses, however, do not have it so easy. Since inheritance goes to the eldest, they must often make their own way in the world, even if it means slumming amongst the lower classes and falling in with adventurers and ne’er-do-wells.",

Its members go into battle without armour to prove they have no fear. They work themselves into an incredible rage, often biting on their own shields. Their feats fill the sagas and loom large in the stories of those Imperial soldiers that have faced them. Some few berserkers make their way to the Empire because they’ve been exiled or simply have a desire to see more of the world. They rarely stay in one place for long, since no Watchman wants a frothing lunatic disturbing the peace. Berserkers are highly prized Mercenaries, however, due to their rarity and effectiveness.",

    "description": "(Core) Imperial justice is swift and merciless. It is no wonder then that so many flee the watch and take on the life of the Outlaw. The hills and forests are full of Outlaw bands. It is a precarious existence, as they must deal not only with Roadwardens, Soldiers, and other agents of law, but also the dark denizens of the wilds. While many Outlaws are nothing more than common thieves, robbing coaches and caravans, others claim to champion the peasantry and fight for “justice not law.” As long as the Outlaws confine their attacks to the rich, the Peasants aid them with food, information, and places to hide. This support, and the rough terrain Outlaws use for their bases, makes them difficult for the state to deal with. Local Nobles often resort to the use of Bounty Hunters to end their bandit troubles.",

    "description": "(SoE) The printing press is a new invention in the Empire, and as yet its presence has not changed much of society. Its presence is however keenly felt among agitators, demagogues, and street politicians who now have a whole new way to reach their public. Pamphleteers are more than just tradesmen with a paper-press: They are passionate individuals who research, write, sketch and print political or religious works in order to spread their message, then disseminate their materials across whole cities and provinces. Although printing itself is perfectly legal and increasingly respectable, many pamphleteers print material that is neither, and those who wish to stay in business have to be skillful at escaping the attention of the Watch or more powerful enemies.",

The science of medicine is relatively new and still distrusted by the majority of Old World citizens. Many regard unknown Physicians as either trumped up apothecaries or dangerous quacks until they’ve proven themselves. Skilled Physicians, however, are often well-respected members of their communities. They are capable of dealing with most minor ailments and a number of more straightforward injuries, such as major cuts or crushing wounds. Physicians are often eager to seek out new medicines and learn about more effective treatments.",

It is easy enough to believe that a race as dim-witted as the Ogres would contribute fights to the death to the culture of the Old World. In years past most Pit Fighters were criminals or prisoners of war. They’d be thrown in a ring or a pit with a few weapons and only the winner would leave alive. These days there is a class of professional Pit Fighters in addition to the condemned. They seek excitement and glory in the pit, though most fight naught but a brutal death as the crowd howls for their blood. Successful Pit Fighters can become wealthy (from prize money and the rampant gambling that surrounds the sport), allowing slave fighters to buy their freedom.",

They are an often reviled and frequently corruptible lot whose ranks include burgomeisters, mayors, and other civil servants. Some are elected to their positions, while others are appointed. Politicians frequently find themselves between various dangerous factions and have to swiftly become skilled at the fine art of compromise. They are experts at saying exactly what people want to hear, though if they actually follow through on their promises, it’s a minor miracle.",

Priests who represent their temples on town councils can – given enough ambition – attain special titles in the court of the ruling noble, or become administrators of temple-owned lands. A prelate’s skill at delivering sermons and debating legal statutes with equal proficiency makes him highly respected in both civic and religious circles. However, the lure of temporal wealth and power has led many prelates down the path of corruption. Prelates may also be known as vicars, curates or arch lectors, depending upon the cult.",

In many cases, Protagonists hide the fact that they are hired help, making up ridiculous excuses to start a brawl with the chosen target. The moneyman watches the humiliation of his foe, for enjoyment or profit of both. Roughing up a few locals is comparatively cheap, while more formidable opponents and more grievous injuries are proportionally more expensive. Most leave outright murder to the Assassins, but exceptions to this rule can be purchased. Jobless Protagonists simply pick their own fights and rob their victims. Needless to say, Watchmen keep a close eye on known Protagonists, so they tend to move quickly from place to place.",

Those knights who have succeeded in their quest have met the Lady in a variety of places, so the quest is not a search for a place. Rather, it is an effort to prove oneself worthy of the Grail. Thus, Questing Knights strive to show themselves to be paragons of knighthood, seeking out dangerous situations in which to uphold the honour of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake. Questing Knights renounce the use of the lance because it is the weapon of loyal service, and a Questing Knight stands apart from the feudal hierarchy until his quest is complete.",

    "description": "(SH) Born with a gift of gab and a desire to use it, Raconteurs are natural storytellers who can be found in taverns, inns, and salons anywhere in the Empire. No matter what the occasion – or even if it’s no occasion at all – the Raconteur has a ready story. He travels from place to place, witnessing marvellous things and weaving a thrilling tale about it all. In a society in which most people cannot read, the Raconteur is both a source of news and entertainment, mixing witty repartee and cutting wit into his stories. To gain his news, a Raconteur might find himself travelling with armies and adventuring bands in the hope of seeing (and surviving) something new and exciting, something that will earn him a few rounds of drinks and a healthy audience at the local inn. Not all Raconteurs enjoy the adventurous life, however. Some stay comfortably where they are and make it all up.",

They aren’t necessarily wealthy but they know how to wear clothes well, to make themselves look good in a dashing and slightly unconventional way. They’re clever, quick, and a little dangerous, like a young cat just come into its full growth and proud of its own speed and claws. Rapscallions are not thieves, though they may steal. They are not duellists, though they may fight duels. They are not scholars, though they may be well-read. What they are is young men with style and grace and flair who like to be in the thick of things. A Rapscallion lives for action, for excitement, and his presence tends to energize others. He can be an excellent ally, a dangerous enemy, or merely a short distraction, but one thing is certain—a Rapscallion is always memorable",

Among the most feared mariners are the Norse Reavers, brutal warriors who plunder the coastlines in search of foodstuffs, gold, and slaves. They are a merciless lot, hardened from their frequent battles with Imperial sailors and the feeble militias that stand against them. Reavers sail the seas to bring booty back to their settlements in their frozen lands. Others sell their souls to the Ruinous Powers, hoping to attract the attention of their uncaring Gods, and gain the power they so crave.",

These strong-backed lawmen are commonly perceived by river goers as little better than thugs, as they must harass even innocent vessels when checking for smuggled goods and have learned that politeness and trust do not pay off. The over-worked patrols, which toil through month-long shifts at a time, are responsible for waters too large to be effectively controlled. They spend most of their time concentrating on the worst law-breakers, including pirates, murderers, and barge thieves, and allow most petty misdemeanours to slip by with spot-fines. They are a common sight on the rivers, and their patrols extend as far as Kislev. Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Riverwarden for Roadwarden with your GM’s approval.",

    "description": "(Core) The Undgrin Ankor, a network of elaborate tunnels that once ran the length of the World’s Edge Mountains, connects the Dwarfholds east of the Empire. Communication between holds is carried out by means of Runebearers – specially trained young Dwarfs who risk life and limb to carry messages (written in the runic script of the Dwarfs) from one hold to another. Over recent centuries, as more Dwarfholds have fallen to the Goblinoids and more tunnels have become ruined, the Runebearers’ lot has become increasingly difficult. They are forced to take more circuitous routes, and even these are fraught with danger as the enemies discover the routes. Often, Runebearers must leave the tunnels altogether and cross mountains and valleys on the surface. Runebearers who specialize in long distances are sometimes used to carry messages between the Dwarf communities of the Empire and those of mountains.",

    "description": "(ToS) Those who serve their Gods as flagellants sometimes survive throwing themselves into danger to smite the forces of Chaos and darkness. Those who survive long enough become scourges of God, mighty warriors for their deity, blessed with a degree of divine protection. Scourges of God are often highly charismatic, and gather other fanatics around them. In times of war, they are highly praised by the cult hierarchy, but when peace comes the priests prefer to move them along as quickly as possible, lest they find too many “enemies of God” within the towns of cities. Most scourges of God die bravely in battle, but some do move on, often to other ways of discovering and punishing the corrupt. Scourges of God almost always substitute the name of their God when describing themselves: scourge of Sigmar, scourge of Ulric, and so on.",

    "description": "(Core) Sea Captains roam the oceans of the Old World seeking profit and adventure over the next horizon. Strictly honourable Sea Captains are far-travelling traders who only sail in search of the most profitable markets for their goods. The most dangerous are bloodthirsty pirates, attacking other ships for plunder and leaving no survivors. Most Sea Captains fall somewhere in between. On a sea-going vessel a Captain’s word is law. Sailors, however, are a fractious lot; a Sea Captain must be clever, strong-willed and a bit ruthless to stay in command. The most famous Sea Captains come from Marienburg, Tilea, and the Elven island of Ulthuan.",

The Greatships, Wolfships, and Wargalleys of the Imperial Fleet patrol these waters, protecting the Empire from Norse longships, Bretonnian buccaneers, and the dreaded fleets of Chaos. Hardened Seaman crew these ships, while their compatriots sail merchantmen, pirate vessels, and other privately owned craft. Elven sailors can be found on the Sea of Claws as well, particularly those engaged by their great Merchant Houses. The activity of the region revolves around Marienburg, the greatest port in the Old World. This city and its surrounding area (known as the Wasteland) used to be the Imperial province of Westerland but it bought its independence years ago. While Marienburg itself is neutral territory, the Sea of Claws is the site of daily clashes. On blood-soaked decks, Seamen earn their rum ration and their booty. Note: During character creation, if you take Common Knowledge (the Wasteland), your character can be from the great port of Marienburg at your option.",

    "description": "(Core) Sergeants are professional warriors who’ve managed to impress either a Captain or a Noble with their ability to command men in battle. They lead small units of Soldiers, Militiamen, Mercenaries and Roadwardens, ensuring that orders are carried out to the letter. Some lead by setting a sterling example, others by terrifying their troops into quick obedience. Those who make their troopers lives a priority tend to be the most popular. The best Sergeants earn the respect of their Soldiers with their own blood and courage. They are often called upon to lead their men into danger and they swiftly become experts at assessing the capabilities of others.",

It is possible for a Servant to work up to a better position, but the path is difficult. No one wants to listen to the lad that was cleaning the privy last week.

To protect their remaining fortress cities, the Dwarfs have trained elite Soldiers who specialize in fighting deep underground. They are the Shieldbreakers, doughty warriors that seek to stem the tide of evil and safeguard their people. While most Shieldbreakers are Dwarfs, members of other races join their ranks from time to time in exchange for Dwarfen gold. Young Dwarfs from the Empire often become Shieldbreakers to prove their mettle and show solidarity with their mountain kin.",

    "description": "(ToC) In the past, slavery was quite common in the Old World. The practice is as old as Humanity, originating in the ancient empire of Khemri, and continued through the various civilisations that rose and fell in the intervening years, leading to the present day. In an evolving economy, slavery is simply impractical. In places like Bretonnia, serfs perform all the work and live lives little better than slaves, but in the Empire, men and women, whilst Peasants, are in charge of their own destinies. Of course, in some remote corners of the Old World, the practice flourishes. Araby is famed for its flesh markets as is Sartosa and even some dark corners in Marienburg. The Norsemen take slaves as well, either from surrendered adversaries or as plunder from one of their raids. Occasionally, they have reason to traffic with unsavoury flesh dealers, and some enterprising Norsemen take up the profession.",

    "description": "(Core) Most of the sea and road trade of the Old World is subject to duties and taxes. Imperial tax collectors, local excisemen, petty lords, and anyone with enough muscle can place a duty on the movement of goods. Legal taxes are bad enough, but many pirates and Outlaw Chiefs also demand a cut to allow safe passage. In large ports like Marienburg, nearly everything moving in or out is taxed in some way. Given this state of affairs, the Smugglers’ trade continues to thrive. While smuggling is, of course, illegal, most folks in the Empire don’t think much of cutting a few corners. In their minds, the taxmen and bureaucrats are the real thieves.",

Though they can appear to be nothing more than glorified Servants, fetching food and wine for their lord or tending to his horses and panoply, the gruelling work is meant to toughen up the Squires and ready them for knighthood. Their lords are also supposed to provide them with martial training, though some are lax in this duty. Favoured Noble sons serve as Squires for a few months at best, while those less fortunate spend years trying to earn their spurs.

Loading a ship is skill- intensive and dangerous work, for vessels can overbalance and capsize if packed incorrectly, and unsecured cargoes can crush the unwary. Within the claustrophobic ship interiors, Stevedores wind “stevedore lashings” (special knots) with wedges of wood to secure and protect the heavy freight. Many Stevedors specialise in “porting” one type of cargo, as each good requires different skills to manipulate, stack and pack correctly. Thus, most larger wharfs have gangs of “porters” that identify themselves according to the goods they import or export, including fish porters, meat porters and deal porters (for timber). None are more famous than the black-liveried coal porters of Nuln, known for their anything-goes attitude and love of bawdy docker songs. Stevedores wear distinctive cloth watch caps dyed with their gang colours, both to identify their allegiances and to protect themselves from the elements. Stevedore gangs jealously guard their wharfs from rivals, and it takes little provocation for them to dish out “lashings” of a different kind. Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Stevedore for Boatman with your GM’s approval.",

While a Noble Lord will often have no idea what he is worth or how much it takes to upkeep his affairs and various holdings, his Steward will know down to the last shilling. As wealthy Nobles tend to have far flung estates, some Stewards may be put in charge of a property and left to their own devices for years at a time.",

Led by Boyar Boydinov – an eccentric noble obsessed with the Empire – they wielded pole-axes rather than axes, mirroring the halberds favoured by the State Regiments of Ostland. In 2345 IC, whilst driving back a Chaos horde alongside Empire allies, the wide-eyed boyar witnessed Imperial black powder for the first time. His kossars were changed forever. Now, many years after the death of Boydinov, the streltsi are the foremost masters of firearms in Kislev, weapons once viewed with fear and superstition. Soldiers from across Kislev travel to Erengrad to earn the crossed “berdysh and handgun” badge, which is awarded to any who train with the streltsi for more than two seasons.",

They roam the Empire in caravan trains or river barges, making money where they can and stealing when they can’t. Their history under the Vampires ensures they maintain their travelling lifestyle, marking them not just as thieves and cutthroats but also necromancers and servants of darkness. In truth, most of them are simple woodsmen, entertainers, or vagabonds, but a few do know something of witchcraft, a little of fortune telling, and a large amount of Vampire lore. These mystics were taught the true and complete history of their people, and they carry the secret knowledge from those ancient days, as well as the promise of their Strigos lords to one day return and lead them back to glory. Note: Strigany mystic is only available to those of Strigany blood. Being of that blood imposes a –10% penalty to all Fellowship Tests when dealing with a person of the Empire. With your GM’s permission, you may substitute Strigany mystic for vagabond when rolling for your Starting Career.

    "description": "(Core) The great cities of the Empire have many universities. Most, like the Imperial School of Engineers in Altdorf, are funded by the state. The first college in the Empire was established in Nuln and that city is still famous for its learning institutions (and, ironically, its Imperial Gunnery School). Students across the Empire can choose from a wide variety of courses, from history to anatomy to science. Of course, many study nothing more than the bottom of a bottle and wash out of school in less than a year. Elven Students don’t go to Imperial universities, but learn from their own loremasters instead. Halfling students are admitted to Universities on sufferance, due to an obscure piece of Imperial Ordinance demanded by the Elder of the Moot.",

    "description": "(BotD) Swampaires are hunters and gatherers of snails and frogs. They take their name from an obscure dialect that essentially means man of the swamps or, more commonly, chaser of frogs. Snails and frogs are the only resource in which Mousillon is rich, and swamping is a prestigious occupation among its peasants. Since all creatures in a swamp are technically owned by the local lord, a Swampaire needs at least the implicit approval of the local noble. Some nobles require lengthy apprenticeships and the swearing of oaths before a man can call himself a Swampaire and be permitted to hunt his lord’s swamps. Swampaires tend to be hardy folk adept at tracking snails and frogs, which is a tricky and time-consuming business at the best of times. Swampaires are normally men, but some nobles have been known to permit a particularly sharp- eyed and quick-fingered lass to hunt in the absence of suitably skilled menfolk. With your GM’s permission, when rolling your starting career you can substitute Swampaire for Hunter.",

They are expected to be above reproach, and to resist the temptation to steal from their own temples. Some cults ensure this behaviour by telling particularly horrid tales of the fate that awaits such traitors in the afterlife, while others simply encourage temple guardians to keep a close eye on one another, rewarding with great wealth any accusation of theft or disloyalty that proves to be true..",

Tomb Robbers are experts in locating such sites and plundering their riches. Secret tombs are usually in dangerous and inaccessible areas. Those within the Empire’s borders are revered and protected by local inhabitants, so accessing these sites can be just as dangerous. Clever traps and deceptions protect the richest tombs and skilled Tomb Robbers must learn to disarm or bypass them. Few survive long enough to raid more than one tomb.",

Who wants to wake up in the same village or city every day, doing the same thing as yesterday? Vagabonds are footloose wanderers who look on each day as a new adventure. They may take on odd jobs here and there to earn some brass, but they never stay in one place for long. The road beckons, with the promise of something better always over the next hill. While they do love to travel, they are not ignorant of the dangers of the road. Vagabonds can thus often be found in travelling companies, formed for mutual protection. The law has little love for these groups and in many places Vagabonds are viewed as common criminals.",

He is responsible for the comfort and appearance of his charge, including grooming, wardrobe, and presentation. A Valet is ready with a hat and cloak when it’s raining, a walking stick for outdoor jaunts, and a dress coat for formal occasions. A well-trained Valet is indispensable for the style-conscious Noble. Though they enjoy a lifestyle most Servants would kill for, Valets often resent the vacuous Nobles they are forced to attend.

    "description": "(SH) Verenan Investigators are agents who look into matters the cult would rather not come to the regular authorities, such as the roadwardens or the witch hunters. They are adept at quiet investigation, looking for clues and observing the scene, rather than extracting possibly unreliable information through torture. Though they usually turn their results over to the cult for further action, they are also ready to take matters into their own hands, if need be. Investigators often come from within the cult itself, although the Verenan hierarchy does not scruple at hiring talented people with questionable pasts, so long as they repent their ways and swear loyalty to the goddess. Verenan Investigators have a wide range of knowledge, and often astound others with their ability to bring obscure information together to throw light on a case.",

    "description": "(KotG) Bretonnian nobles are responsible for bringing justice to the peasants. If they hear of a crime, they make sure that someone is punished. As long as it’s a peasant, they do not worry about which peasant. In some cases, the lord has hanged the victim. Most peasants would prefer to avoid such “justice.” Instead, they turn to their Village Elders, respected residents of the village. These old men listen to the details of the case and then hand out punishments. Often these involve paying reparations to the victim, normally in labour, but sometimes the Village Elders arrange “accidents” for the criminal. The quality of this justice depends entirely on the quality of the Village Elder, as there are no checks on his decisions. A senile elder is still capable of handing down something less than justice. However, it is still almost invariably better than appealing to the local lord.",

    "description": "(RoS) Witches that use Dark Magic and embrace its power can become Warlocks if they survive its perils long enough to gain the required knowledge. They may not realize it at first, but this is a dangerous path that leads almost inevitably to corruption. They are the bogeymen of the witch hunters, the spellcasters that are a danger to themselves and to others. Warlocks tend to be either Daemonologists or Necromancers. Since they are self- taught and so much of their magic is based on experimentation, however, most Warlocks have unique views of magic and the world. It is this individuality that makes it so hard for the witch hunters to root them out.",

These warrior priests have a threefold responsibility: ministering to the faithful amongst the army, offering spiritual and tactical advice to the army’s leadership, and smiting the unfaithful in battle. When war comes to the temple, a cult’s warrior priests take charge of its defence, marshalling the rest of the cult to repel attackers. Warrior priests are usually members of holy orders, such as the Sigmarites of the Order of the Silver Hammer. Most warrior priests come from the cults of Sigmar, Ulric, and Myrmidia, although other cults are not without a few token militant brethren.",

This has cut down dramatically on corruption, though the army itself is not immune. Watchmen are responsible for maintaining law and order and are empowered to make arrests. They also double as fire fighters in smaller towns. For some Soldiers, watch duty is a temporary assignment. For others, it becomes a lifelong career.",

    "description": "(RotIQ) Every Gospodar settlement annually raises a rota of winged lancers. Each spring, eager young men muster alongside veterans and don armour at their rotamaster’s command. To the sound of weeping womenfolk, they ride, their winged banners fluttering behind them. Until their return, they are known as the “Riders of the Dead,” for they are mourned as if already deceased. Every rota of lancers has a different character. Where some southern examples are like Imperial knights, sporting colourful pennants, intricately decorated armour, and great animal pelts, lancers from beyond the Lynsk are more akin to Ungol nomads, having heavy moustaches, top-knots, and fur-lined charms to ward against evil.",

    "description": "(Core) Witch Hunters are grim individuals who have dedicated their lives to eradicating the forces of Chaos, either in the service of the state or the Church of Sigmar. They prefer to seek out Chaos cultists, Mutants, and heretics that have insidiously hidden amidst the cities of the Empire. However, they will travel far indeed if they think they can strike a meaningful blow against the forces of evil. Witch Hunters tend to be a surly and suspicious lot with no qualms about killing innocents, so long as they also manage to slay the guilty, which means their appearance is often regarded with dread by other folk.",

    "description": "(WC) The long rivers of the Old World are dangerous places, made all the more so by Wreckers. These river pirates seek to sink vessels and then raid the wrecks. Their techniques for doing this vary, although most lure the unwary into rocky shallows to hole their hulls. Although only interested in cargo, some Wreckers make a habit of killing, wary of escapees that may inform Riverwardens of their identities or locations. In lean times, it is not unknown for entire communities to turn to wrecking to feed their starving families. Whilst most are of these are desperate and only “short-term” sorts, some Wrecker crews are very experienced, targeting even well guarded traders. Such crews rarely stay in one place for any length of time, for their activities soon draw attention from Riverwardens, Bounty Hunters and local Militiamen. Note: If you are rolling randomly for your Starting Career, you can substitute Wrecker for Smuggler with your GM’s approval.",

    "description": "(KotG) Yeomen are the elite peasant warriors of Bretonnia. Many knights are dismissive of their achievements, arguing that “elite peasant warrior” has a similar meaning to “large mouse.” However, whilst it is true that the nobility are far better equipped, the Yeomen are as skilled as most Knights of the Realm, and they take justified pride in their martial abilities. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Yeomen are dedicated professionals because it is their dedication that has distinguished them from the mass of Men-at-Arms around them. Yeomen, in return, receive mounts and are used for scouting missions that are unsuited to knights (too little glory, too much risk). Eventually, some Yeomen grow tired of making things easy for “social superiors” and strike out on their own. Most lords allow their Yeomen to retire honourably after a few years of service or after a spectacular act on the battlefield. Others, however, simply desert, usually whilst on a scouting mission so that their lord assumes they were killed and doesn’t go after them.",
